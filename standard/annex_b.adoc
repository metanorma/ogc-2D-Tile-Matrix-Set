== Schema Documents

In addition to this document, this standard includes several normative Schema
Documents.
These Schema Documents are posted online at the URL http://schemas.opengis.net/tms/2.0.

The schemas for both JSON and XML encodings of TileMatrixSets are reproduced in the
<<annex-example-encodings-for-common-tilematrixset-informative>> section of this
document, along with examples. Additional examples are found in the
<<annex-example-encodings-for-variable-matrix-width-informative>> section.

The schemas for both JSON and XML encodings of TileSet Metadata are reproduced in the
<<example-encodings-for-tilesetmetadata-informative>> sections of this document,
along with examples.

[[b1-json-schema]]
=== JSON Schema

The JSON Schema Documents are situated in the json subfolder and are named:

* json/tileMatrixSet.json
* json/tileMatrixLimits.json
* json/tileSet.json

They include the schemas necessary to JSON-validate the classes JSONTileMatrixSet,
JSONTileMatrixSetLimits and JSONTileSetMetadata, respectively.

In addition, the directory named `json/examples/tilematrixset` contains examples of
the JSON TileMatrixSets encodings,
while the directory named `json/examples/tileset` contains examples of the JSON
tileset metadata encodings.

[[b2-xml-schema]]
=== XML Schema

The XML Schema Documents are situated in the xml subfolder and are named:

* xml/tilematrixset.xsd
* xml/tilematrixlimits.xsd
* xml/tileset.xsd

They includes the schemas necessary to XML-validate the classes XMLTileMatrixSet,
XMLTileMatrixSetLimits and XMLTileSetMetadata, respectively.

In addition, the directory named `xml/examples/tilematrixset` contains examples of
the XML TileMatrixSets encodings,
while the directory named `xml/examples/tileset` contains examples of XML tileset
metadata encodings.
