== Variable width TileMatrixSet definitions

This annex includes definitions for TileMatrixSets utilizing the variable width
capability.
This capability allows for the coalescence of tiles in specific rows so that the
overall width of the tile matrix is divided among fewer tiles.
This is particularly well suited to define global grids in an Equirectangular Plate
Carrée projection, where tiles closer to the pole cover a smaller physical area
than tiles at the equator.

Such TileMatrixSets may therefore attempt to approximate equal area tiles.
This makes them especially suitable for defining a global grid, which may form the
basis for defining a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) as defined in
http://www.opengis.net/doc/AS/dggs/2.0[OGC Abstract Specification Topic 21 - Part 1],
and _Axis-Aligned DGGS_ per _OGC Abstract Specification Topic 21 - Part 4_.
Because the resulting tiles would likely only tend towards equal area but still be
off by a significant margin,
such a DGGS could not however conform to the _Equal-Area Earth DGGS_ conformance
class of _Topic 21 - Part 1_, which specifies a maximum threshold of 1% difference.

The https://ecere.ca/gnosis/[GNOSIS] Global Grid Tile Matrix Set defines tiles in the
Equirectangular Plate Carrée projection (EPSG:4326 CRS)
for the whole world while still attempting to approximate equal area tiles, even near
the poles.

Starting at the tile matrix with identifier 1, a variable matrix coalescence factor
is applied for polar tiles to tend towards equal area.

One can define an arbitrary number of zoom levels and do not need to include all the
ones defined here. Here, 6 zoom levels are illustrated.
Levels 0 to 28 are officially defined, allowing to reach 2:1 scale while the matrix,
row and column identifiers can still fit together within a single 64-bit key.

It is easy to implement procedurally: it is a quad-tree starting with eight 90 x 90
degree tiles at level 0,
with the exception that tiles touching a pole are split into 3 tiles rather than 4 --
the polar portion is not split longitude-wise.
Therefore, there will always be only 4 tiles touching each pole.

NOTE: The GNOSIS Global Grid scales match the _GoogleCRS84Quad_ Well Known Scale Set,
but starts at the third scale of the set.

NOTE: Aside from the variable width considerations, the only other difference with the
<<variant2,WorldCRS84Quad TileMatrixSet>>
is the fact that the latter starts at the second scale of the WKSS -- its TileMatrix
identifier 1 is equivalent to
the GNOSISGlobalGrid TileMatrix identifier 0.

This CDB 1 Global Grid Tile Matrix Set defines tiles in the Equirectangular Plate
Carrée projection (EPSG:4326 CRS) for the whole world, based
on the level of details and zones defined by the
https://docs.ogc.org/is/15-113r6/15-113r6.html[OGC CDB 1.x] specifications,
which can be encoded following this standard with the use of variable widths.

For the tile matrices with negative identifiers of the CDB 1 Global Grid, the tiles'
geographic extents remain the same as those of tile matrix 0,
but the tile size in cells is reduced. The levels -1 to 1 are shown here.
For the CDB 1 Global Grid, the polar adjustment zones corresponding to coalescence
factors are the same (at a given latitude) for all tile matrices of the set.
