[[tms-json-encoding]]
=== JSON encoding

The JSON encoding is defined respecting the naming and types of the original classes.
However, there are some differences. <<table10>> describes some exceptions in the
mapping between the class attributes and corresponding JSON element.

.propertiesSchema attributes and JSON Schema properties equivalences
[options="header"]
|===
| Class attribute | JSON element | Reason

| identifier | id a| Following common practice in GeoJSON and JSON-LD.
| BoundingBox class a| array of 4 numbers representing lowerLeft and topRight
coordinates a| Follows GeoJSON (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946)
suggested encoding.
| LanguageString | string a| JSON files are generally used in the OGC API as
monolingual documents. The language of the document is determined by the HTTP
language negotiation headers.
| keywords | string array a| JSON files are generally used in the OGC API as
monolingual documents. JSON does not use namespaces or codespaces.
| WKT | object a| The WKT encoding for JSON is an object representing a JSON encoding
of the WKT for CRS 2.0 defined by https://proj.org/specifications/projjson.html
|===

[NOTE,keep-separate=true]
====
This Standard adopts the https://proj.org/specifications/projjson.html encoding,
pending a resolution in the CRS group for adopting a possible future JSON encoding
for WKT for CRS 2.0
====

In addition, all elements with multiplicity greater than one have names changed to
plural. Please be aware of irregular plurals such as `tileMatrix` that changes to
`tileMatrices`.

The XML encoding is defined respecting the naming and types of the original classes.
However, all attribute names have been transformed to UpperCamelCase.
